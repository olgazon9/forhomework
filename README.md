# For Loops - Homework - John Bryce Academy

## Introduction
This repository contains my homework assignment for the topic "For Loops" in JavaScript at John Bryce Academy. The purpose of this homework is to reinforce my understanding of for loops and their usage in JavaScript. By completing these assignments, I aim to gain valuable hands-on experience in solving problems using for loops in JavaScript.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `assignments/`
  - `javascript/` (Contains my JavaScript assignments)

## Instructions
1. Complete the JavaScript assignments: Inside the repository, you will find a folder named "assignments/javascript." This folder contains several JavaScript assignments that involve using for loops.
2. Implement the solutions: I have written the code to solve the problems using for loops in JavaScript.
3. Commit my changes: As I complete each assignment, I commit my changes using `git commit` with appropriate commit messages to track my progress.
4. Push to my GitHub account: Once I have finished all the JavaScript assignments or made substantial progress, I push the changes to my forked repository using `git push`.
5. Create a pull request (Optional): I can create a pull request to contribute my solutions to the original repository if I wish to share my work with others.
